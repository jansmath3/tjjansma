		<div class="casehd">Summary:</div> 
		<p>This project required building a Drupal 7 website and integrating it with our current Drupal and MySQL code base.</p>
		<div class="casehd">Requirements:</div>
			<ol>
				<li>Full CMS</li>
				<li>Simple to update</li>
				<li>Minimalist design</li>
				<li>Distinct design that did not reference focusdc.org design aesthetics.</li>
			</ol>
		<div class="casehd">Problem:</div> 
		<p>How do I create a CMS that cannot share commonalities with its parent site?</p>
		<div class="casehd">Solution:</div> 
		<p>This is a secondary site for the community outreach component of FOCUS and turned out to be a fairly simple build. The design was to be minimalist, but needed to be kept separate from focusdc.org. I received very little push back on design and the initial project was completed in about a week. Originally, I built the site in wordpress, but branched out to a Drupal 7 multi site instance to simplify updates and unify the sites' code base.</p>
		<div class="casehd">Outcome:</div>  
		<p>This was probably the easiest site I've had to build. It is lightweight and managed by a fairly technically proficient staff member. Updates have been simple and the site has had few issues in the couple of years it has been up.</p>
